We're currently focusing on Part III:

Sec. 1  - Alphyte % done, mod proofreading
Sec. 2  - derivada.schwarziana % done (mod details)
Sec. 3  - JohnDS % done modulo proofreading.
Sec. 4  - walter % done from Lemma 4.7. Happy to do up to half if there's no takers. Have managed to knock out >= a page/10 minutes so not too much of a committment on my half. --George  %john taking over finishing the rest---done except for 3 diagrams, anyone else want to do the diagrams feel free too!
Sec. 5  - Manan % done mod proofreading
Sec. 6  - DarQ % done mod proofreading
Sec. 7  - Manan % done mod proofreading
Sec. 8  - Little Narwhal % done mod proofreading
Sec. 9  - zxcvly % done mod proofreading
Sec. 10 - Average enjoyer (diagrams by George) % done / proofreading
Sec. 11 - Little Narwhal % done mod proofreading
Sec. 12 - Slurp % done mod proofreading.
Sec. 13 - Wew Lads Tbh!
Sec. 14 - Yohan %done, need someone to proofread it.
Sec. 15 - JohnDS and Little Narwhal %done mod proofreading
Sec. 16 - Susilian %done mod comm.diagrams require some adjustments. Doing this from the bottom upwards and we can meet in the middle --George
Sec. 17 - George - this is still left, if anyone wants to finish it. Done

for part I, to be done after III has been registered(you can pick more than 1 or all of these, in total this is only 20 pages after all):

Sec. 1-  % done? fixed two errors here --deri
Sec. 2-  % Taken over by Yohan as of now, only waiting for proofreading
Sec. 3-  % Taken over by Yohan as of now, only waiting for proofreading
Sec. 4- % sorry for abandoning you but im not able to work on it good luck --daenorks %I've completed this locally, ping me if it's needed --George. Loaded from local on request
Sec. 5- George --loaded from local
Sec. 6- Average enjoyer % done / proofreading
Sec. 7- Manan % done mod proofreading
Sec. 8- Zach  - this is still left, if anyone wants to finish it (finished by Average enjoyer) % done / proofreading

For part II, to be done after III has been registered (you can pick a few sections at once, as the average section here is quite small)

Sec. 0-wordslinger%done
Sec. 1-George%done
Sec. 2-(unknown -- left blank) % done / proofreading. Done, forgot to claim here --George
Sec. 3-Little Narwhal % done mod proof reading
Sec. 4-Little Narwhal % done mod proof reading and renumbering equations
Sec. 5- wordslinger% done, citations needed
Sec. 6-Little Narwhal % done mod proof reading and renumbering equations
Sec. 7-George %done bar minor things
Sec. 8-George %done
Sec. 9-George %done bar minor things
Sec. 10-George %done bar minor things
Sec. 11-George %done bar minor things
Sec. 12-wordslinger%done
Sec. 13-wordslinger%done mod proofread
Sec. 14-wordslinger%done bar citations
Sec. 15-Whoever %done mod references
Sec. 16-George %not sure how to do alignment middle of page 111
Sec. 17-derivada.schwarziana % done -- check the comment

To do:
Fix reference:
We are at the endstage of the book, we can start fixing these. So add in the right reference for bib stuff in places, and restructure the labelings of theorem. We are going to uniformize it to format:
\label{thm:pxchxx.x} , change thm out with lem, cor, sec, rmk etc. a lot of the reference of these are also broken, so fix those too. Anyone want to do this feel free too.

Bibliography: We are leaning biblatex for this, if someone has a different opinion feel free to share. But you can start working on this as the other sections are taken up.

%George: I've done most of this but I've erred on a few citations and have omitted others that are repeated from Part II to Part III.

part 1 bib-
part 2 bib-
part 3 bib-

Indexing: Someone with knowledge of the topic can look through the book and find things to put in the index. doing word \index{word/description} will put it in the index with page number and a link.

Proofreading: Some of our sections are done, you can proofread these. Someone with knowledge on the topics might be useful here as a lot of errors might come from just not knowing the math (the topic is fairly advanced).
