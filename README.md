# Adams-Blue-Book
The TeX for Adams' blue book, by the group TeXromancers

The files are just as it was in our overleaf. This is a bit unorganized as it was our first project and we were figuring things out. 

Feel free to download and change for example font to better fit your preferences. Your can report errors to my email at amanzoo at asu dot edu, or at my discord JohnDS#1149, or as changes to this github with documentation of what was changed.
